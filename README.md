# Streetwear Commerce Platform - React CRUD Application

This project is a dynamic web application designed for the management of a streetwear commerce platform. Leveraging the power of React alongside modern web technologies, it provides a comprehensive system for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) product listings. The primary aim is to offer an intuitive interface for administrators to manage inventory and for customers to browse the latest in streetwear fashion.

## Project Overview

The repository consists of React components, utility functions, and styling assets that together create a seamless user experience for both administrators and users of the platform. It utilizes React's state management and component lifecycle methods to ensure real-time updates and interactive UIs.

## Contents

- React Components:
  - `ProductList.js`: Displays all products in a grid layout.
  - `ProductForm.js`: Form component for adding or updating product details.
  - `Navbar.js`: Navigation bar for easy navigation throughout the platform.
  - `Footer.js`: Footer component with contact information and useful links.
- Utility Scripts:
  - `api.js`: Handles API calls for CRUD operations.
  - `utils.js`: Contains utility functions for form validations and data formatting.
- Styling:
  - `main.scss`: Main stylesheet that defines the global styles and themes of the application.
  - `components/`: Directory containing individual styles for each component.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Utilized for its efficient rendering and state management capabilities, enabling dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Adopted for its static type-checking abilities, enhancing code quality and maintainability by making the codebase more robust and understandable.
- **CSS/SCSS**: For custom styling and theming of the application, leveraging SCSS for variables, mixins, and nested rules to write more maintainable stylesheets.
- **Node.js and npm**: Node.js as the runtime environment and npm for managing project dependencies.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing, allowing navigation between different components without reloading the page.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client used for making API requests from the browser, handling asynchronous data fetching with ease.
- **MySQL**: Used as the relational database management system to store and manage the application's data securely and efficiently.
